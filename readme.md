# MAGIC Gamma Ray Classification 🔭

This project explores machine learning techniques to classify between **gamma rays** and **hadron showers** using the **MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset**. Built and tested on Google Colab as part of my early steps into machine learning.

## 📌 Dataset

- **Name**: MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset  
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Type**: Binary classification (Gamma vs Hadron)  
- **Features**: 10 continuous input features from high-energy particle interactions  
- **Target**: `1` for gamma, `0` for hadron

## 🧠 Objective

Predict whether a given set of features corresponds to a **gamma ray** or **hadron** using various machine learning classification models.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Google Colab**  
- **Python**  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn` for ML models

## 🔍 Models Tried

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
